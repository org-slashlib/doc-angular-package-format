## documentation - building angular packages ##

Note: Check documents in folder <code>docs</code>

The goal of this test project is not to create an own angular packager (https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-packagr), but to demystify the package creation process a bit.

The question is: What is created, how, and where does it belong to, in order to produce an executable package at the end?

Todo:
  "typings": "org.slashlib.doc-angular-package-format.d.ts"
  "metadata": "org.slashlib.doc-angular-package-format.metadata.json"
  public-api.d.ts

Secondary entry points (testing):
I will skip that, because it's just copy/paste of primaries...
